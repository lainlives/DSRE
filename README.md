# Deep Sound Resolution Enhancer

## Description
DSRE is a **high-performance audio enhancement tool** that can batch-convert any audio files into **high-resolution (Hi-Res) audio**.
Inspired by Sony DSEE HX, it uses a **non-deep-learning frequency enhancement algorithm**, allowing fast processing of large batches without heavy computation.

**Key Features:**

* **Batch Processing**： Convert multiple audio files at once.
* **Multiple Formats**：Supports WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, etc.
* **Preserves Cover & Metadata**：No manual editing required.
* **Flexible Parameters** Modulation count, decay, high-pass filter, etc.
* **Fast & Stable**： Does not rely on deep learning, fast processing.
